\title{Calculating the distance matrix between living parasite branches, as well
that of associated hosts}

\item{cophy}{a cophylogeny (object of class "cophylo") containing one host
and one parasite tree.}
}
\description{
The following function returns a matrix of the patristic distances between
all extant parasite species, and another matrix with the patristic distances
of the associated host species.
